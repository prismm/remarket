                    The goal of remarket is to improve the efficiency and trust-level of secondhand transactions -- in other words, to make it
                    safer & easier to find, buy, sell, and give away stuff, so that less stuff in our communities gets thrown away and more gets reused.</div>

Currently, 4% of landfill waste (9 million tons per year) is furniture waste; when people throw away usable furniture, it increases demand for new furniture which leads to greater material consumption and deforestation.</div>

                    through the user's network email address domain (nyu.edu or columbia.edu). To view posts belonging to either network,
                    toggle the 'NYU' and 'Columbia' buttons in the header. <span className="nyu-selected">NYU posts are purple</span> and <span className="columbia-selected">Columbia posts are blue</span>.
                    All posts are flagged with their author's affiliations, and you can find a user's affiliations by clicking on their name and viewing their profile.  </div>
